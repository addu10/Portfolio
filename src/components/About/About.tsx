              I am a passionate and dedicated Information Technology student currently in my 4th year of BTech at CUSAT. 
              My current focus revolves around AI Models, Automations, and I&apos;ve been actively building my skills in this area through experience gained through projects and internships.
            </p>
            <p>
              My technical journey began with learning programming fundamentals, and I&apos;ve since expanded my knowledge into web development, 
              data analysis, and application development. I&apos;m particularly interested in creating efficient and user-friendly solutions 
              that solve real-world problems. Then I shifted my focus to AI Models, Automations, and Web Scraping, which allowed me to work on projects that were more challenging and interesting.

            <p>
              Beyond technical skills, I value collaboration, continuous learning, and effective communication. I feel I could adapt to any new technologies and tools that are introduced to me with ease.
              I&apos;m seeking opportunities to apply my skills in a professional environment and contribute to meaningful projects.
